1 # use [id -u]  to check for the root user if 0 mean you are root user
2 how to get files if ssh and scp is not working 

3 use kubectl get pods -o wide | grep deployment_name

4 kubectl get svc 	//to get info about service

5 kubectl create service loadbalancer name_of_your_service  --tcp=80  //service is loadbalacer at port 80
`	[not open in browser by default]

6   By default service name is different but deployment name is same as app service by default

7 service has selector which will talk to LABEL of pods

8 kubectl edit deployment deploy_name

9 kubectl edit svc tusharbaba  // go to this and add label name get by 8
	to selector in yaml file as name in label of deployment [selector in last sections]


10 To change the service :
	go to as same as 9 and put in last line [type=NodePort ] rather loadbalancer
